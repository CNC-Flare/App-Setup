# Installing Guide
---
1) First Add Crosspost-Auth To the subreddit

1) Once installed Make 3 New Saved Respones
    - Un-apporved Cross-Post
    - Cross-posting Same Content
    - Subreddit was Ban from crossposting


**these 3 respones are used for when Crosspost-Auth removes a post**
*** Note These Saved respones Are planned to move to internal code.

Un-apporved Cross-Post: Not in Aprroved list
Cross-posting Same Content: if cross-post was made withing the last (hour, day, week, ect...)
Subreddit was Ban from crossposting: Subreddit is not allowed to cross post to this reddit

3) remove any Crossposting items under auto-mod. At this time using both might conflict with eachother.

4) Crosspost-Auth auto adds all the mods and the apps that are listed as Mods. to help jump start posting mods might need to add some high karma Users to the list.
